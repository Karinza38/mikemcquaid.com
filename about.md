Hello. My name is Mike McQuaid and I'm a software engineer.

I live in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Feel free to [tweet me](http://twitter.com/MikeMcQuaid) or [email me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}) to say hello.

My [curriculum vitae/resume](/cv.md) details my professional experience.

Until I got married in 2010 my name was Mike Arthur.
