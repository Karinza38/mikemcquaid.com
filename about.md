Hello. My name is Mike McQuaid and I make great developer tools.

I live in Edinburgh, Scotland. You should visit, it's nice here.

Feel free to [send me a message on Mastodon](https://mastodon.mikemcquaid.com/@mike) or [email me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}) to say hello.

My [curriculum vitae/resume]({{ '/cv/' | absolute_url }}) details my professional experience.
