### Mike McQuaid
Iâ€™m a software engineer who loves solving difficult problems to simply people's lives.  

I always welcome new opportunities and will travel 1/6 weeks to work anywhere in the world. The other 5/6 weeks I must be able to telecommute from my home in Scotland.  

No recruiters who won't immediately tell me the name of the company.
