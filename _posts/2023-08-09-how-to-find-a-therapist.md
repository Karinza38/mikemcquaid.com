In 2020, due to the "fun" combination of COVID-19 and two young children at home, I wanted to see an (individual) therapist.
At the time I was employed by GitHub, which had a program where I could get up to six sessions paid for by them.
After five of these, I'd found some benefits but wanted to try a different approach with a therapist of my choice.
Based on my experience finding a therapist, I've outlined how I (and several friends at this point) went about doing so.

- 1) Go to the [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com) "**Find Counselling**" page for your location e.g. [Edinburgh](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/counselling/sct/edinburgh), [London](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/counselling/eng/london), [Dublin](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ie/counselling/county-dublin/dublin), [New York](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/ny/new-york), etc.
- 2) Filter by "**Issues**" relevant to you or that you want to address, process or seek help with.
- 3) Filter by “**Types of Therapy**” if you know enough already to have an opinion.
     In my case, my free work sessions were [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) and, through my research, I thought [psychotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy) would be a better fit to explore some childhood issues.
- 4) Filter by "**Gender**" if you have a preference.
     I struggle with talking to men about some issues so picked "Show Me Women".
- 5) Filter by "**Insurance**" if you have health/medical insurance that you want to use to pay for your therapist.
     I have never had health insurance so paid directly.
- 6) After exploring their profiles, select 3-8 therapists that align with your requirements.
- 7) Email them to ask about availability.
     Bear in mind that not all of them might have immediate openings.
- 8) Arrange one-off meetings (which may be paid or free, depending on the therapist) with 2-4 of them.
     Let them know you are trying to find a therapist, are meeting multiple and the first session is a mutual evaluation for fit.
- 9) Pick one, email them arranging a first session, and email all the others thanking them but letting them know you're going with someone else.
     If you didn't find someone: go back to Step 6 and see if anyone else fits.
     If you still didn't find someone: go back to Step 2 and consider loosening your filters.
- 10) All your problems in life will be instantly fixed. Ok, not really but: some of them will get better, I promise!

If you're still on the fence about seeing a therapist at all, you might find these anonymous therapy podcasts to be informative and interesting:

- [Esther Perel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Perel)'s ["Where Should We Begin" podcast](https://www.estherperel.com/podcast) and ["How's Work?" podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hows-work-with-esther-perel/id1497580407)
- [Lori Gottlieb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lori_Gottlieb)'s and [Guy Winch](https://www.guywinch.com/about/)'s [Dear Therapists podcast](https://lorigottlieb.com/podcast/)

If you're still on the fence: try it and see if it helps.

Good luck!
