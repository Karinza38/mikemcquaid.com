title: Making Dizzy Shine With Ajax
---
### Abstract 
_"Ajax applications can provide a more effective user interface than those of GUI desktop or classic Web applications with fewer drawbacks than either individual approach."_

In this report, the preceding hypothesis was evaluated by developing an Ajax Web application for the Dizzy chemical kinetics stochastic simulator [2] and analysing the benefits and drawbacks compared with the existing Dizzy classic Web application and Dizzy GUI desktop application. Among the benefits were those of a more responsive interface, less bandwidth usage and allowing logic to be output to the client. The drawbacks included the challenge of ensuring cross-browser compatibility, unfamiliarity to the user, JavaScript debugging issues and the time-consuming nature of re-engineering an existing Web application.
