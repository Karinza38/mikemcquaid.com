Unfortunately, the required skills for success drastically differ between ICs and managers. Do you need to transition into a position you may not enjoy or excel at to progress in your career?

In this talk, I'll present another way: the staff-plus IC career track, allowing career progression without people management, inspired by my experiences moving through Senior and Staff positions to my current position as a Principal Engineer at GitHub.
